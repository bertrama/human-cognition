# 1.1 Brain Cells

## Orientation

The cells of the brain are the foundation of cognition, thought, consciousness, perception.  Everything that makes us who we are. Cells in the brain are divided into neurons and neuroglia. The brain has a fairly complex structure, and though a lot can be learned about the differences in how its larger parts work, we will focus on the processes that arise from the behaviors of neurons.

Though neuroglia are critical to brain function, for the purposes of this model they're mostly taken for granted.
